# CSE 1400 Mandatory and Bonus assignments
This repository hosts all of the source code to the assignments (Y1Q1) for Computer Organisation (CSE1400).

This code was written for the mandatory and bonus assignments of CSE1400 at TU Delft. This repository organizes each project into its own folder to avoid using many repositories.

### Codestyle
- The code hosted in this repository will be indented using TABS. 
- Any instructions will be indented using a SINGLE tab. 
- All instructions require a postfix expression to be specified explicitly to avoid any ambiguity or confusion.
- Please refer to section 1.3 of the "Lab Assigment Manual" for the Rules, Regulations and Etiquette.
- Subroutines must contain both a prologue and epilogue.
- To exit the main function, thus the program, call `exit`.

### Lab documentation
Please refer to Brightspace to obtain a copy for the "Lab Assignment Manual" and "Lab Content Manual".
The "Lab Assignment Manual" describes the specification for each mandatory or bonus assignment. Secondly, it describes how to get started with assembly and also how to debug it.

The "Lab Content Manual" describes and explains the GNU assembly programming language, containing all of the useful information needed to code in x86-64.
