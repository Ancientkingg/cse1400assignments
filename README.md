# CSE 1400 Mandatory and Bonus assignments
This repository hosts all of the source code to the assignments (Y1Q1) for Computer Organisation (CSE1400).

This code was written for the mandatory and bonus assignments of CSE1400 at TU Delft. This repository organizes each project into its own folder to avoid using many repositories.

### Codestyle
